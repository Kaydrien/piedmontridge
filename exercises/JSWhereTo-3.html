JS Where To EXERCISE 3:

Add script named myFunction in a JavaScript file named "JSWhereTo.js" that changes the text
of the paragraph with an ID of "demo" from "A Paragraph." to "Paragraph changed."

Clicking the "Try it" button should execute the function.

You peek at the w3schools script by looking here: https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js

Make sure to add the JavaScript file to git before checking your code in. :-)
