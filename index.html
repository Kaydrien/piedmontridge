      <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
      <p>Our purpose is to speak as the utterances of God.
“If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen,” (1 Peter 4:11).

Our purpose is to do whatsoever we do, in word or deed, all in the name of the Lord.
“And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him,” (Colossians 3:17). </p>

      <h3>God's Truth</h3>
      <p>God has given us all truth that pertains to life and godliness.
“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue,” (2 Peter 1:3).

God has promised that we can know the truth.
“Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free,”                                     (John 8:31, 32). </p>

      <h3>God's Help</h3>
      <p>Things that are impossible with men are possible with God.
“And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God,” (Luke 18:27).

God has promised that he will make a way for us to bear temptation.
“There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it,” (1 Corinthians 10:13)

God has promised that he will completely finish the good work he has begun in us.
“Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ,” (Philippians 1:6). </p>

      <h3>Basics</h3>
      <p>It is our purpose to follow the format of the assemblies described in the New Testament scriptures, as well as the reasons behind that format.

Assemblies took place on the first day of the week.
“And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight,” (Acts 20:7).

Disciples were required not to forsake the assembling.
“Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching,” (Hebrews 10:25).

All things in the assembly were to be done decently and in an orderly manner.
“Let all things be done decently and in order,” (1 Corinthians 14:40).

      <h3>Lord's Supper</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the assembly was, first and foremost, to take the Lord’s Supper.
“And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight,” (Acts 20:7).

The Lord’s Supper was specifically not to be taken as a common meal.
“When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper. For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken. What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not,” (1 Corinthians 11:20-22).

      <h3>Speaking</h3>
      <p>Any Christian man could speak in the assemblies (extemporaneously, if necessary): as few as two and as many as three in a given assembly.
“Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted,” (1 Corinthians 14:29-31).

Women were not allowed to speak in the assemblies.
“Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church,” (1 Corinthians 14:34, 35).

      <h3>Singing</h3>
      <p>Any Christian man was allowed to speak, lead a song, or pray. All of it was to be done for the purpose of edifying.
“How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying,” (1 Corinthians 14:26).

All disciples sang to each other in unison.
“Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,” (Ephesians 5:19).

A collection for the saints was taken on the first day of every week.
“Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come,” (1 Corinthians 16:1-2).</p>
